# Payment System Duckpay
[Leia esta página em português :brazil: ](./README.md)

This project simulates a payment system for development, testing, and demonstration purposes. It provides a controlled and simulated environment to test the integration of payment systems without accessing a real production environment.

## Future Features

- **Transaction Simulation**: The system allows the simulation of different types of payment transactions, such as credit card payments, payments via digital wallets, etc.
- **Test Data**: Realistic test data has been provided to simulate various scenarios, including successful transactions and transactions that may be declined due to reasons such as insufficient balance, expired card, etc.
- **Detailed Logs**: The system generates detailed logs of each simulated transaction, allowing developers to follow and analyze the steps involved in processing.

## Disclaimer

This is a simulation for testing and development purposes only. It does not handle real financial information and should not be used in a production environment. We are not liable for any misuse or consequences resulting from the use of this simulated payment system.
